### What's covered?

1. Testing with Jest and Enzyme.
2. Server-side rendering
3. Context API
4. Higher order components

I would highly recommend this course. Not only did it give me a good understanding of the above, but also there are small many small tricks that can make one's development experience luxurious: code snippets, eslint, etc.
